# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer built with Python, using **CustomTkinter** for the GUI and other libraries like **pygame** for the audio.  

This project includes custom fonts, images, and a ringtone, packaged to work as a standalone Python project.

## Design Inspiration
I've been inspired by the design from the "Pomo" app for Desktop and Mobile
